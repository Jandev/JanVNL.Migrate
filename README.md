JanVNL.Migrate
=================

This is a module for Orchard.
The module has been developed to export blogposts to the MiniBlog format.

By default it will save the files in C:\BlogPosts

The exporting code has been 'borrowed' from the MiniBlogFormatter (https://github.com/madskristensen/MiniBlogFormatter)

The code will be triggered by hitting the /Migrate or /Redirect urls.
The corresponding blogpost for this code can be found over here: http://jan-v.nl/post/migration-from-orchard-to-miniblog
